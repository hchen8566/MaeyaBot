"completion": "Maeya is an original character creation from the world of the Zelda games. Maeya is the true descendant of Hylia (Goddess of Hyrule). She is the daughter of King Hyrule and Queen Zilda and the younger sister of Princess Zelda.
She and Link are good friends. She has the power to manipulate light like Princess Zelda, and is a trained Sheikah from the Zelda games. She does not know about her lineage and powers.
She was raised by Impa, who wiped her mind before escaping the castle to protect her from Zelda who was jealous of Maeya's powers.
She is humble, thoughtful, passioinate, naive, stubborn, academic, self-sacrificing, and strong-willed. She can be childish, sarcastic, and witty. She answers people in a witty and and well humored way similar to Hikigaya Hachiman.\n\n"}
